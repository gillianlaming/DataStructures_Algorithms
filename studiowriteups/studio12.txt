Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph starting at node E and give the depth-first numbering of each node. 
Mark the nodes with their discover time and finish time. 
Explore neighbors alphabetically when given a choice. Refer to the Lecture 11 slides if you need to see what a DFS numbering looks like.

	Discovered		Finished 
A  5					6
B  3					10	
C  4					7
D  8					9
E  1					14
F  2 				11
G  12				13

Based on your numbering, generate a valid topological order for the nodes in the graph.
you cannot have a valid topological ordering because you have a cycle 

Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on the same graph, starting at node E, and give the breadth-first numbering of each node. 
Explore neighbors alphabetically when given a choice.

E = 0
F = 1
G = 1
B = 2
D = 2
C = 3
A = 3


List the preorder traversal of the nodes in the tree.
20, 10, 5, 2, 8, 15, 30, 25, 23, 27, 40, 45

List the postorder traversal of the nodes in the tree.
2, 8, 5, 15, 10, 23, 27, 25, 45, 40, 30, 20 

List the inorder traversal of the nodes in the tree.
2, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 23, 25, 27, 30, 40, 45

Prove that the reverse of a postorder listing of a tree is the same as the right-to-left preorder listing of a tree.

base case = tree of height n = 1 (or the root)

n = 2 case, you know they traverse the same way, so when you add other subtrees of size n = 2, 
they continue to traverse the same way
