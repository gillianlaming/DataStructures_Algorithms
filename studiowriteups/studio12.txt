Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph starting at node E and give the depth-first numbering of each node. 
Mark the nodes with their discover time and finish time. 
Explore neighbors alphabetically when given a choice. Refer to the Lecture 11 slides if you need to see what a DFS numbering looks like.

Based on your numbering, generate a valid topological order for the nodes in the graph.

Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on the same graph, starting at node E, and give the breadth-first numbering of each node. 
Explore neighbors alphabetically when given a choice.

List the preorder traversal of the nodes in the tree.

List the postorder traversal of the nodes in the tree.

List the inorder traversal of the nodes in the tree.

Prove that the reverse of a postorder listing of a tree is the same as the right-to-left preorder listing of a tree.
