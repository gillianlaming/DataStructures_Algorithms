Part 1. Introduction


1. Give your own definition for what a crypographic key is 
A cryptographic key is a string of bits that are used to change normal text into encoded text, also determines the output.

2. Explain the differences between public, private, and shared keys 
a public key is one know by the public, a private key is one only known by one person, and a shared key is a key known by the two people
exchanging encoded messages.

3. Is Diffie-Hellmann an encryption algorithm? **
no, it is a method for exchanging a shared key.
 
4. Encryption is often confused with hashing, can you think of a reason why? what is the main difference? 
hashing you assign a numeric value to an object, encryption you change the object so that it looks like a different object. you can't
de-hash a value, but you can de-crypt a value.

5. bonus: should passwords be hashed or encrypted before they are stored in a database? why? 
hashed, because it's more secure


Part 2. Caesar Ciphers


For the following messages and keys, give the output of the caesar encryption:

1.HFY

2.CHEUD

3. PAS

for the following message/encrypted message pairs, give the key

1. 7

2. 5

3. 15


Part 3. Diffie-Hellmann Key Exchanges


before starting make sure you are able to answer the following questions:

1. what values must be agreed upon by both parties beforehand? 
the base and the mod values

2. how many private keys are used? 
two- one for each person

3. what is the equation to calculate the public keys?
base^(private key) % modulus

4. what the equation to produce the final shared keys? 
shared value^(private key) % modulus

5. how many of the secret numbers need to be known in order to crack the algorithm? 
just your own!
